Company Visit Notes:
	* List of Departments

Database Improvements:
	UPDATED TO ITERATION 2!
	* Intern / Extern value?

	Database needs:
		Email History table?


	Database Expansion:
		Staff Table: Could include references to possible staff entities. This would make it possible to store information about staff and specify even further if wanted!

Frontend/Backend Improvements: 
	Sorting of subtasks. 
	Sorting tasks according to deadline. (Closest Deadline ontop) (This is subsort after initial sort, where Tasks are loaded Prio First -> Regular)?

	Some way to edit an existing tasks information (In case a task gets Approved, but now it gets a deadline).

	A way of Approving Completion (Button / Link under Expand, same place as SubTask Creation.) Confirm dialog, as this is a one way only.

	PW Encryption stuff: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/212510/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-encrypt-a-password-when-i-save-it-to-the-registry

	Frontend Expansion:
		It's possible to make it so the frontend adapts to the login given, so certain passwords have access to certain modules. (1 for staff, 1 for boss).

BUGS:
	

BugFixes:
	Postbacks were causing the dropdown menu to reset causing insert statement to insert NULL values
	Partial hit unfolding subtasks
	No longer needing to redo first task_status change
	Fixed Database whitespacing problem
