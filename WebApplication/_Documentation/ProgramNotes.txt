Company Visit Notes:
	* List of Departments

Database Improvements:
	UPDATED TO ITERATION 2!
	* Intern / Extern value?

	Database needs: 
	* Login Table (For different passwords? (Just one at first))
	* Additional column in tasks for ultimate finish. (Approved Complete)


	Database Expansion:
		Staff Table: Could include references to possible staff entities. This would make it possible to store information about staff and specify even further if wanted!

Frontend/Backend Improvements: 
	Sorting of subtasks. 
	Sorting tasks according to deadline. (Closest Deadline ontop) (This is subsort after initial sort, where Tasks are loaded Prio First -> Regular)

	Some way to edit a existing tasks information (In case a task gets Approved, but now it gets a deadline).

BUGS:
