Database Expansion:
	Staff Table: Could include references to possible staff entities. This would make it possible to store information about staff and specify even further if wanted!

Database Improvements:
	From Iteration 1 -> 2 I want to improve the database to include more details about the tasks. This includes:
	* Task_CreationDate (When the task was first put into the system.)
	* Task_CompletionDate (When the task was flagged completed by the user)
	* Task_ApprovedDate (When the task was approved by the board)
	- Is it possible to remove the "Task_IsBigTask" variable as this isn't needed with the current setup.

Frontend Improvements: 
	Images for the vertical cells (Status Cells), to make them more uniform.
	Notification that the user is in editing mode, to make it more visible that he can interact with the table.
	Sorting tasks according to deadline. (Closest Deadline ontop) (This is subsort after initial sort, where Tasks are loaded Prio First -> Regular)

	If user is editing, set Session State that user is editing, so when the user clicks buttons and refreshes, we check this var. If Editing, don't hide buttons and make the 
	Edit toggle button in the "Editing" state!

	Add Submission form for creation of new tasks * THIS IS PRIO BEFORE Thirsday!!!!!
